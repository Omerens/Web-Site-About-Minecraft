        <h1>Step1: What You Need?</h1>
        <p>What you Need is

            711 Red wool blocks
            
            128 black wool
            
            122 light grey wool
            
            185 white wool
            
            35 grey wool
            
            (If you want to explode it & fill it with TNT you need)
            
            2,730 TNT blocks
            
            1 lever
            
            16 redstone
            
            1 redstone repeater.</p>
        <h1>Step 2:The Skeleton </h1>
        <p>First Make a Bare skeleton of it. The base is 16 X 16 Then on the corners stack up 5 with red then 6 in white then 5 more red. Then (Follow the third picture) and make of the white area with white lines of wool. You just made like panes the bottom ones will be red the middle ones white and the top one red.</p>
        <h1>Step3:Filling in the Panes </h1>
        <p>Now we are going tho fill in the panes with wool remember the bottom & top ones are red. The middle ones white.

        </p>
        <h1>Step4:Filling It In </h1>
        <p>I you decided to fill it in and explode it then read this step. If not then go to the next step. So now fill it in with TNT all the way to the top this will take a while.

        </p>
        <h1>Step5: The Top </h1>
        <p>Now put a top on it in red wool.

        </p>
        <h1>Step6: Fancy Up the Top</h1>
        <p>Now we are going to put a fancy top on it. If you want you can skip this step as it is only for looks. Just follow the pictures and I will help you along. For the first 3 pictures replace the red with light gray and gray wool. Then on top of the red (use picture 4 to help you with this) Place black wool in the shape of string.

        </p>
        <h1>Step7:TNT Sweet Words </h1>
        <p>Now go to the white sections and replace some of the white with black wool spelling out TNT. Now using light grey wool put them as you see in the picture to get a more TNT look.

        </p>
        <h1>Step8: Time to Blow It Up</h1>
        <p>Here is the fun part. Lead redstone up to the TNT block with a repeater. Then go to the other end of the redstone place your lever and pull it. Now Watch the fun. I suggest saving before so after you blow it up you can exit without saving and have it back.

        </p>
        <h1>Step9: That's It!</h1>
        <p>Thats all as you can see in the picture it is almost a exact replica of the real thing. I hope you enjoyed this instructable and don't forget to vote.
