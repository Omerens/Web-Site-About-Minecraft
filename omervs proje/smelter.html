        <h1>Step1:What You Need?</h1>
        <p>1 furnace
            3 chests
            3 hoppers
            6 blocks of your choice
            2 item frames
            1 piece of coal
            One piece of meat, iron, (or anything else you would put in a furnace to smelt)</p>
        <h1>Step2</h1>
        <p>First you place 3 blocks then place a hopper on top of the third block. Then place one on the left side of the third block. Now break the 3rd block.

        </p>
        <h1>Step3</h1>
        <p>Now place a furnace on that second block then you break the block underneath the furnace and on the one underneath the one you just broke put a hopper facing down. Now break that last bock and put a chest in its place.

        </p>
        <h1>Step4</h1>
        <p>Go 4 blocks up on the left side and place and chest over the middle hopper and then take down the bottom three of the 4 blocks now go up 5 blocks on the right side and place a chest over the top hopper now break the bottom four of the five and leave the top one.

        </p>
        <h1>Step5</h1>
        <p>Now grab your two items frames and placed them on the two floating blocks that are next to the top 2 chest on the item frame that is next to the top chest place the meat or iron. On the block that is next to the middle chest put a piece of coal or charcoal now put two blocks of your choice on top of each other on the right by the bottom chest on the ground and then on the left side as well this that has no purpose but it makes it look better.

        </p>
        <h1>Step6: That's It</h1>
        <p>How it works is you put your meat iron gold or whatever else you want to cook or smelt in the top chess then you put your coal in the middle chest the hoppers underneath the chests then put them into the furnace and when it is cooked or smelted the hopper underneath the furnace puts it in the bottom chest.
