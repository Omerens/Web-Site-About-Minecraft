        <h1>Minecraft Strategies For Beginners</h1><br><br>
        <h2>Name and Shape the Place.</h2>
        <p>I know you won't have any trouble here. Name the place where you will live. Depending on the name, you can either create an idyllic habitat or a place with terrifying creatures. It is also possible to shape your space with "More World Options". While the Superflat option gives you the maximum chance to create your world, in Default and Large Bomes you only have the opportunity to add new things. The choice is yours!</p><br><br>
        <h2>Be Creative!</h2>
        <p>There are 4 game modes in Minecraft: Surival: Hardcore, Adventure and Creative. If you want to quickly improve yourself in the game or get maximum pleasure from the game (or both), choose Creative mode. Because in this mode, it is entirely up to you what kind of space you will create. You can arrange all kinds of objects as you wish, like a sandbox, and create a colorful world.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Arm Yourself!</h2>
        <p>Be prepared for future dangers. All kinds of dangers await you, from slimes to zombies, from spiders to Endermans. If you are unarmed, you are unprotected; if you are unprotected, you are far from victory. That's why it is necessary to be armed.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Build a House</h2>
        <p>The most important requirement for a comfortable ascent in Minecraft is to build a house. If you build a house, you can easily defend yourself. More houses means more protection. When you are far from another living space, build your own city and build roads from house to house (see Expand your borders).
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Be in Touch With People
        </h2>
        <p>If you have built a city, be sure to place people in it [press E in Creative After pressing, click on the Lava bucket icon, click on the brown and dark brown egg, place it in inventory, place it on the 9-number toolbar when needed, press the number in whatever order it is (1 through 9) and then press F] , because if there are no people in the place you live, your effort is in vain.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Expand the Borders
        </h2>
        <p>When you first enter the area in Minecraft, it is not clear where you will spawn. This area may be close to or far from another living area. Regardless of whether they are close or far away, these two concepts mean the same thing under this heading: You must expand the borders. Build your own city, build roads, streets, neighborhoods from house to house, grow it and turn it into a country and a planet. This is the golden rule of ascension in Minecraft.
            A large humanoid creature, whose number increases over time, will begin to wander around your city. Don't try to kill him! Because it protects you from zombies and archer skeletons. However, if you are in Survival Mode or Adventure Mode, keep a little distance from that creature, as those creatures will also harm you, but do not kill them. But you have to protect those creatures against Endermans!</p><br><br>
        <h2>Build Farmhouses
        </h2>
        <p>This is actually an addition that will make the ascent easier and give a more solid foundation to the city you are building. But if you want, you can build farms and farmhouses. But one element of this supplement, the "family home", is actually mandatory and can only be located in your city as a single entity, provided that it can be developed and enlarged over time.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>How to Make Houses in Minecraft?
        </h2>
        <p>First of all, the size and shape of the house is designed in mind. Then, stones (or wood) are taken and an area is selected. Then, the first string that creates the size and shape of the house is lined up. Then the second string and the third string are lined up (you can increase the number of strings if you want). A 2x1 area is left empty at the front for the door. Then the top of the house is covered with whatever material you used. If you want, you can make a roof and a chimney. Then the door and the citizens (as many as you want) are placed and the construction of the house is completed.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Create the Transportation
        </h2>
        <p>The means of transportation is the second golden rule of ascension. Transportation by train, boat or pig For this, rail, water or saddle selection is made.

        <h1>Minecraft Strategies For PvP</h1>
        <h2>Using a Shield</h2>
        <p>Shields are the most effective tools used to block attacks. By using the shield, it is possible to block attacks and take better defensive positions.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Fast Running</h2>
        <p>Fast running is a good strategy to escape or chase players. It also allows you to dodge attacks or follow the enemy.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Flying</h2>
        <p>Flying allows you to dodge an enemy's shot or attack from a better position. However, due to the limited energy bar, caution must be exercised while flying.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Relocation</h2>
        <p>A good strategy is to reposition to evade or evade the enemy's attack. It also allows you to determine the enemy's position and take a better attack position.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Concealment</h2>
        <p>Concealment makes it harder for the enemy to find you and protects you from their attacks. It also allows you to identify the enemy's position and attack before they do.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Priority Target Selection</h2>
        <p>Target selection allows you to identify your most dangerous enemy and neutralize them. This allows you to deal with other enemies more easily.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Teamwork</h2>
        <p>Teamwork makes attacks more effective and successful. Also, since you defeat the enemy more easily, you will take less damage.</p><br><br>
